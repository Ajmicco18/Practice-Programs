## Practice Programs 
This repository contains a collection of programs using a variety of languages including C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, that I have done outside of the classroom to make myself a better programmer. 

- ### Super Bowl Block Generator
This program created in C++ uses a random number generator to generate two sets of numbers in the range 0-9 to create a typical Super Bowl Block pool. Inserting the names of each individual involved, utilizes multi-dimensional arrays to create a 10x10 grid. 

- ### WebDevTutorial
This folder contains html files from a web development YouTube tutorial I followed while attempting to learn how to develop websites. 

- ### currency_converter
This application is from another YouTube tutorial I watched that illustrated how to make a simple currency converter using the React framework and a currency converter API. 

- ### python_practice 
This folder contains Python files that I used to learn how to use Python in. The programs include simple calculations, data structure initalization, and other simple skills I learned while getting my feet wet with Python. 

- ### react-pokedex/pokedex
This folder contains a Pokedex I created while attending a talk at HackYSU in 2023. The Pokedex uses a React framework and a Pokemon API to create a paginated list of all the different Pokemon. 

- ### reactTutorial
This folder contains two projects that I created while watching a React tutorial. The myproject folder contains examples of simple JSX functionality explained in the tutorial, while the todoList folder contains a todoList program that utilized the skills explained throughout the React tutorial.

- ### todo-list
This program is from a YouTube video I watched to better understand the React framework and web developement tools such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The todo list allows you to input a todo and click a button to add it. You can also remove it by clicking on a checkbox or the remove icon next to the todo in the list.
